## Multiplication Table
Problem: Write a program that generates and displays the multiplication table of a number provided by the user. The table should be displayed from 1 to 10. Use a do-while loop to print the multiplication table.

This project demonstrates how to generate a multiplication table for a given number using the do-while loop in C. The code asks the user to input a number and then displays its multiplication table up to a specified range (e.g., 1 to 10).

## Example
```
Input: Enter the number for table: 5
Output:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
5 x 11 = 55
5 x 12 = 60
```

## How It Works
The program first prompts the user to enter a number for which the multiplication table is to be generated.
A do-while loop is used to multiply the given number by values starting from 1 up to the desired range.
The loop runs until the specified limit is reached, ensuring that the multiplication table is fully displayed.

## Features
User-friendly input prompts.
Clean and simple logic using a do-while loop.
Easily customizable range for the multiplication table.
