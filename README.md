This project demonstrates how to generate a multiplication table for a given number using the do-while loop in C. The code asks the user to input a number and then displays its multiplication table up to a specified range (e.g., 1 to 10).

###Example

###How It Works
The program first prompts the user to enter a number for which the multiplication table is to be generated.
A do-while loop is used to multiply the given number by values starting from 1 up to the desired range.
The loop runs until the specified limit is reached, ensuring that the multiplication table is fully displayed.

###Features
User-friendly input prompts.
Clean and simple logic using a do-while loop.
Easily customizable range for the multiplication table.
